# Enactus Timelog Analysis
In this repository you find analysis performed on the timelogging data gathered from Enactus DCU society members.
Anytime a member attends an event, organises a meeting, works on the development of their project or carries out research they log their time. The JSON data is pulled into a jupyter notebook, parsed, analysed and visualised using the pandas and seaborn python libraries.
This repository contains several directories with specific purposes.
